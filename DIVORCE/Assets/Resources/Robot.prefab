    robotSentences1:
    - "Now that you\u2019re the PM, you can decide what type of nation you want us
      to be. Do you want a very wealthy one? Do you want to unite all our people or
      empower our leaders?"
    - "You can also try and balance them all out, but judging by the last PM, this
      can backfire and can leave you with a nation that doesn\u2019t know what it
      wants."
    - "Just don\u2019t let your personal interests affect your decision making. Are
      you ready for your first day, boss?"
    robotSentences2:
    - "First, let\u2019s check what your daily tasks are, they are written on the
      whiteboard."
    robotSentences3:
    - Okay, it seems we have quite the day ahead of us! Before we begin, let me give
      you a tour around the office.
    - "If you look at this screen over here, you\u2019ll find the values of important
      statistics you need to be aware of."
    - Keep in mind that all your decisions will affect them, so think before you act!
    robotSentences4:
    - 'You can also see some useful information about how these stats interact with
      each other on the cork board next to the screen. '
    robotSentences5:
    - "The fax machine and the trash can are over there, better remember that cause
      you\u2019ll be using them a lot! "
    robotSentences6:
    - "Oh, boy! Look at the time, remember, you\u2019re only working until 6PM, so
      we better get on with it!"
    robotSentences7:
    - "We have split up the policies into folders, based on which planet they mainly
      affect. Let\u2019s choose an Earth policy to enact now so you can get used to
      it."
    - To interact with an object, look at it and press the F button, this works with
      various items around the office.
    robotSentences8:
    - Browse through the policies available and pick one that you think is needed.
    - 'Keep in mind, whenever you enact a policy, the other ones in the same subsection
      will not be available anymore! '
    robotSentences9:
    - "That\u2019s a good one, I like the way you think!"
    - "Now, to enact the policy, go and fax it or throw it in the trash bin if you\u2019ve
      changed your mind!"
    robotSentences10:
    - "Hey, that\u2019s the phone ringing!"
    - Lets answer and see what they want!
    robotSentences11:
    - Right! You heard them!
    - If you want to comply with their request, fax the paper they sent you, if not
      - just trash it!
    robotSentences12:
    - Ok, it seems like you have some time until your scheduled conference call at
      5.
    - "Why don\u2019t we enact another policy?"
    robotSentences13:
    - "That\u2019s the conference call now, boss!"
    - You better answer it and be careful what you say to the earthlings, your words
      will affect our relationship with them.
    robotSentences14:
    - "That went well! I can already tell you\u2019ll be a great Prime Minister!"
    - "Let\u2019s just quickly see what the result and consequences of your actions
      today is and you can go home!"
    robotSentences2_1:
    - Ah! Morning Boss! Sleep Well?
    - 'Me too, the whole 24.3 minutes! Ready for day 2? '
    robotSentences2_2:
    - "Hm\u2026 Who could this be so early in the morning?"
    robotSentences2_3:
    - "The wife, eh? I\u2019ll add her request to the board later so you don\u2019t
      forget, they say family is everything!"
    - In the meanwhile though, check out this new folder that just came in!
    robotSentences2_4:
    - These are Moon Policies! They can alter and shape the way the moon will be governed
      and how your citizens will live.
    robotSentences2_5:
    - "You enact them the same way as regular policies.Why don\u2019t you try one
      now?"
    robotSentences2_6:
    - Another good one! Seems like you have a knack for this!
    robotSentences2_7:
    - You might want to check the board! I updated the daily tasks to fit today's
      agenda from the Cabinet.
    robotSentences2_8:
    - Today, among other things, we have to send requests to other planets, asking
      them to provide free healthcare to Moon citizens when they visit.
    - "To do so, you should get on that computer doo-da of yours at your desk and
      use the \u2018Contacts\u2019 section."
    - This will take the same amount of time that choosing a policy does.
    - You should pick one now, just so you know how.
    robotSentences2_9:
    - "Now that you\u2019ve printed it, you can go and fax it to them, or you can
      trash it."
    - "They\u2019ll decide whether to accept or decline it tonight. Let\u2019s hope
      you do not frustrate them by then! Ha-ha."
    robotSentences2_10:
    - What do you wanna do now? You can enact a policy or send another one of those
      requests?
    robotSentences2_11:
    - 'Good call with that one, boss! You are practically a master at this already! '
    robotSentences2_12:
    - "Policies, requests\u2026 OH! And calls too!"
    robotSentences2_13:
    - "Don\u2019t look at me for advice! I wasn\u2019t programmed for that!"
    robotSentences2_14:
    - Might wanna get up there, boss! The Martians are a strange folk!
    robotSentences2_15:
    - "Long day, eh? Let\u2019s just quickly check how it went and you can go rest
      with the family."
    robotSentences3_1:
    - Hey, boss! How are you doing this morning?
    - "Yesterday was fun, wasn\u2019t it? Hope you are ready for more of that!"
    robotSentences3_2:
    - "Oh, I guess I\u2019ll have to get used to the phone ringing this early, eh?"
    robotSentences3_3:
    - "The wifey again, huh? I\u2019ll add her request to the board again so you don\u2019t
      forget."
    robotSentences3_4:
    - So how do you wanna start today?
    - "Wanna enact a policy? Or maybe continue with the healthcare issue if you haven\u2019t
      requested it from all the other planets?"
    robotSentences3_5:
    - "That\u2019s a good choice, boss!"
    robotSentences3_6:
    - "It is 5PM, boss! Didn\u2019t your wife ask you to leave at this time?"
    - "But you\u2019ll miss the conference call if you do!"
    - "Boy, that\u2019s a tough choice\u2026"
    robotSentences4_1:
    - Good morning, boss! Did you get your 8 hours?
    - "Let\u2019s just wait for your wife to call and we\u2019ll start, ok?"
    robotSentences4_2:
    - Hm, I guess she told you all she wanted before you left home, huh?
    - I guess we can begin then?
    - If you look at the board, the cabinet have requested that you arrange for our
      people to be able to travel to Earth without needing a visa or something like
      that.
    - You can do that from the contacts folder on your PC.
    - You can try to arrange the same for other planets too, but the cabinet have
      not request that specifically, so it is up to you.
    - So how do you wanna start today?
    robotSentences4_3:
    - "This is like second nature to you by now, isn\u2019t it?"
    robotSentences4_4:
    - And there goes the phone again! I bet it is something important!
    robotSentences4_5:
    - I guess she slept late today, huh?
    - "Do you want me to add it to the board? I\u2019ll add it to the board."
    robotSentences5_1:
    - Well, here it is Boss!
    - "The final day, it\u2019s been fun, and unbelievably stressful, but mostly fun."
    - All we have to do today is to finally decide if we want to go with all of your
      policy choices from the past few days.
    - "You should take a look on the computer at all the choices you\u2019ve made
      so far, and really think about if these were the right choices."
    robotSentences5_2:
    - Okay, now if you like your manifesto and are happy with your current stats,
      take it to the fax machine and send it to the solar system, leading the way
      for a new moon!
    - "Or, if you don\u2019t like it so much, you should throw it away, and I can
      get Earth on the phone and see if they take us back? Maybe try again?"
    - Remember, this is about the whole Moon, not just us, so choose wisely.
